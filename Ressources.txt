Ressources are whatever is immutable data (models, textures, sounds...).

Ressources references are stored as a path in chunk's on-disk data (relative to /, which is the root of the game's Ressources filesystem)
When something request a Ressource, it is searched in a hash map which is the list of loaded Ressources.
If it is not found, it is scheduled to be loaded and put in the database, if possible, the Data is given a generic Ressource to work with until the actual Ressource is loaded (for example, a generic red square in the case of a model requested by the renderer).
