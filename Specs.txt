Core concepts:
    Core rules:
        - space in the Universe is divided in Chunks
        - Chunks contains any Data relevant to the zone they represent
        - Data in the Chunk is only visible from within the Chunk or through a Connection.
        - Chunks can contain other Chunks
        - Objects can move.
        - Data can move between Chunks.
	- The script exchange zone is a table of IDs which give access to a stack (as such to enable concurrent access to the ID and making the scripts reading the ID able to retrieve everything other scripts set it as).
	- When a stack in the the script exchange zone is empty, it is deleted with more or less haste (TBD in function of optimization)
	- Chunks are loaded and their members considered for rendering if all those conditions are fullfilled:
		- they are bigger than a pixel on the screen (so if a huge chunk is really far away, it wont get loaded because because it would be smaller than a pixel on the screen)
		- some form of occlusion check (TBD)
    Side rules:
        - There is no 'draw distance', only variable LODs, which may include 'not being rendered'
        - Any information that is related to an Object should be kept by it.
        - Only information affecting multiple Objects or that is not relevant to Objects should be kept as non-Objects non-Universal Data.


Definitions:

(Voc): Vocabular Definition
(Type): In-Engine type

externally(Voc): 'out of the chunk'
locally(Voc): 'within the chunk'
limited access(Voc): can only communicate to an object it has a Connection with.
universal access(Voc): can communicate with all objects within defined scope.

Universe(Voc): Every Data handled by the engine.

Data(Voc)(Type): Anything managed by the Engine.

Connection(Voc): Saying there is a Connection between two Data mean they are aware of each other.

Chunk(Voc)(Type)(Data): Variably sized zone of space defined as a right rectangular prism/rectangular cuboid. It can contains any kind of Data that is not universal to the whole Universe, which makes that data local to a zone of space, to a chunk.

Object(Voc)(Type)(Data): Data with a visual representation. It cannot be universal.

ChunkObject(Voc)(Type)(Data): Object that is also a Chunk

Rule(Voc)(Type)(Data): Data with no visual representation that has universal access locally and limited access externally. It cannot be universal.

Property(Voc)(Type)(Data): Data with no visual representation that has limited access locally and externally. It cannot be universal.

SuperRule(Voc)(Type)(Data): Data with no visual representation with universal access to the Universe (ex: Physics)


X is forward
Y is right
Z is up
